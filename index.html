<p>Ctrl-V Engineering is a group bringing Controls Engineering and Embedded Systems to everyone. All our projects are free to use and modify, and they always will be!</p>

<h2>
<a id="project-r" class="anchor" href="#project-r" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project R</h2>

<p>Project R is our first project, a how-to guide for Controls, and a software library of powerful tools for design, analysis, and application. Our how-to guide, <em>Controls Engineering from Scratch</em> is currently under development. Our software library is coming soon.</p>

<h3>
<a id="controls-engineering-from-scratch" class="anchor" href="#controls-engineering-from-scratch" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Controls Engineering from Scratch</h3>

<p>Learn about the theory behind the tools used in Controls research and applications today, completely from scratch. This how-to guide and series of video tutorials (coming soon!) will cover all sorts of topics from Set Theory, Linear Algebra, Calculus, Differential Equations, and System and Signal Analysis.</p>

<h3>
<a id="ctrl-v-software-library" class="anchor" href="#ctrl-v-software-library" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ctrl-V Software Library</h3>

<p>Get some context behind all of the theory and use our tools for quick and easy Design, Modeling, Simulation, System Identification, Analysis, Optimization, In-the-Loop Testing, Validation, and much, much, more. This library is coming soon.</p>
