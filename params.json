{"name":"Ctrl-V Engineering","tagline":"Tutorials and code for learning all about Controls Engineering and Embedded Systems. Start from scratch and go anywhere!","body":"# Welcome to Ctrl-V Engineering\r\nCtrl-V Engineering is a group bringing Controls Engineering and Embedded Systems to everyone. All our projects are free to use and modify, and they always will be!\r\n\r\n## Project R\r\nProject R is our first project, a how-to guide for Controls, and a software library of powerful tools for design, analysis, and application. Our how-to guide, _Controls Engineering from Scratch_ is currently under development. Our software library is coming soon.\r\n\r\n### Controls Engineering from Scratch\r\nLearn about the theory behind the tools used in Controls research and applications today, completely from scratch. This how-to guide and series of video tutorials (coming soon!) will cover all sorts of topics from Set Theory, Linear Algebra, Calculus, Differential Equations, and System and Signal Analysis.\r\n\r\n### Ctrl-V Software Library\r\nGet some context behind all of the theory and use our tools for quick and easy Design, Modeling, Simulation, System Identification, Analysis, Optimization, In-the-Loop Testing, Validation, and much, much, more. This library is coming soon.\r\n\r\n# I/O\r\nContact us at vdd@ctrl-v-eng.com with any comments or questions, we'll be happy to help!\r\n\r\n# About Us\r\nCtrl-V Engineering was started in 2015 by Victor Dorobantu, an Engineering student at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY. His current work is in Control of Autonomous Systems.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
